# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection
# My First project
Implemented a machine learning project focused on predicting Parkinson's Disease
using various algorithms including SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Naive
Bayes, and XGBoost. Cleaned and preprocessed the Parkinson's Data Set, engineered
features, and assessed model performance. Contributed to potential advancements in
early disease detection techniques, providing a foundation for future research in
Parkinson's Disease diagnosis.
